# ERG 

An attempt to define a domain specific langage like IaC but for enterprise risk management and governance within financial institutions. 

## Solves a Problem

All financial insitutions have some inherent level of regulatory obligation. Regulatory obligations (or requirements) can be expressed in code, but are often expressed in documents and delivered through human efforts. The documentation and human efforts usually fall short. ERG intends to abstract regulatory requirements and merge them with general business requirements (i.e., rolling business objectives) such that planning and change efforts can be managed and reported at the requirements level. 

A few other ways to say this: 

1. Policy as Code
2. Organization as Code
3. Change as Code

### High Level Goal

Emulate the funcationality of Terraform and the general concepts of IaC within the domain of enterprise risk management and governance.


### Project Objectives

In order of priority
1. Define Syntax (status: not started)
2. Design Application (status: not started)


### Note to Users

Nothing to see here. Come back later


### Note to Contributors

I am starting my developer journey with this project and will be building in the open. I really don't know what I'm doing but if I can't figure out how to use Copilot_GPT_Youtube then I should just go home. I'd welcome your guidance and support.
